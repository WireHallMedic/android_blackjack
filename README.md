# android_blackjack

A simple card game, to get some practice in Flutter. It's called android_blackjack, but there's nothing Android-specific about it.

There is additional functionality under the hood, such as being able to specify how many decks from which to make the shoe, the point at which to reshuffle, and keeping track of how many games since reshuffling. Initially I was going to have a mode for practicing card counting, but didn't wind up going that way.

Feel free to make this fancier.
